# SQLite-Roster-Database-Project
This project demonstrates how to use Python, SQLite3, and JSON to manage and query a relational database of users, courses, and membership roles.  The program reads data from a JSON file, inserts it into a database (roster.sqlite), and performs queries to retrieve and display information.
